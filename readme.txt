This repository contains implementation code for the inference procedure in Yap, L (2024): ``Inference with Many Weak Instruments and Heterogeneity". (https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.11193)

It contains the following R files:
1. L3Ofn.R: this contains all implementation functions
2. generate_data.R: this generates data
3. demo.R: this calls on the previous two files to generate simulated data from the paper and implements the procedure
